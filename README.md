# Exercice - Cadavre Exquis : Lisa 
**Once upon a time**, in a room of the PÃ´le Image building, four colleagues met around a table to solve a common exercise. 
This exercise seamed quite simple for some, while it was a real challenge for others. 
*But please, continue the story ... *
Even if it was challenging for some, the idea was to help each others. 
That being said, even with each other helps, some were quicker, some slower.
However, there is no shame in this. We are a group, and there is no first or last place.
