# Exercice - Cadavre Exquis : Lisa 
**Once upon a time**, in a room of the PÃ´le Image building, four colleagues met around a table to solve a common exercise. 
This exercise seamed quite simple for some, while it was a real challenge for others. 
Even if it was challenging for some, the idea was to help one another. 
That being said, even with each other's help, some were quicker, some slower.
However, there is no shame in this. We are a group, and there is no first or last place.
The place is beautiful but it gets quite hot. 
The coaches are nice and helpful. 
It's the same for the other people working at BeCode!
It's difficult sometimes because we're not working on the same OS.
But at least we have coffee !
Coffee is life. Love coffee, love life. Love Be code!
